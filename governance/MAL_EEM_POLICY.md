## 1. Overview

MAL-EEM (Master Application Layer - Ethics & Empathy Module) is the ethical governance framework for the ASI-T2 ecosystem. It establishes guardrails, decision logging, and enforcement mechanisms to ensure responsible development and deployment.

## 2. Core Principles

### 2.1 Peaceful Use
**All ASI-T2 systems must be used for peaceful, constructive purposes.**

- ✅ **Permitted**: Civilian applications, protective capabilities, public safety
- ❌ **Prohibited**: Weaponisation, offensive operations, facilitation of harm

### 2.2 Dual-Use Control
**Sensitive capabilities must be controlled and monitored.**

- Export control compliance (EU 2021/821, ITAR/EAR as applicable)
- Risk assessment for dual-use technologies
- Restricted access to sensitive subsystems
- Regular audit of capability deployment

### 2.3 Decision Transparency
**Autonomous decisions must be logged and auditable.**

- Full audit trail of automated decisions
- Human oversight for critical decisions
- Explainable AI/ML models
- Public accountability for system behavior

### 2.4 Human Dignity
**Respect privacy, autonomy, and wellbeing of all stakeholders.**

- Privacy by design
- Informed consent
- Data minimization
- Right to appeal automated decisions

### 2.5 Environmental Responsibility
**Minimize environmental impact and support sustainability.**

- Climate impact assessment
- Resource efficiency
- Zero-emission targets
- Circular economy principles

## 4. Prohibited Uses (Absolute)

The following uses are **strictly prohibited** under any circumstances:

1. **Autonomous Lethal Weapons**: No autonomous decision to use lethal force
2. **Indiscriminate Systems**: Systems that cannot discriminate targets
3. **Mass Surveillance**: Dragnet surveillance without judicial oversight
4. **Discrimination**: Systems that discriminate based on protected characteristics
5. **Manipulation**: Deceptive or coercive user manipulation
6. **Environmental Harm**: Intentional environmental damage
7. **Human Rights Violations**: Facilitation of torture, repression, or abuse

## 5. Decision Logging & Audit

### 5.1 Required Logging
All automated decisions must log:
- Timestamp (nanosecond precision)
- Decision context and inputs
- Decision output and rationale
- System state and version
- Operator/user identity (if applicable)

### 5.2 Audit Requirements
- Logs stored in append-only, tamper-evident storage
- Regular automated analysis for anomalies
- Quarterly human review of decision patterns
- Annual external audit
- Public transparency reports

### 5.3 Retention
- Critical safety decisions: Permanent retention
- Operational decisions: 7 years minimum
- Personal data: Per GDPR/applicable privacy law

## 6. Kill-Switches & Emergency Controls

### 6.1 Emergency Shutdown
Multiple independent mechanisms to halt operations:
- **Level 1**: Service-level shutdown (automated)
- **Level 2**: System-level shutdown (operator)
- **Level 3**: Platform-level shutdown (multisig)
- **Level 4**: Physical disconnection (manual)

### 6.2 Trigger Conditions
Automatic shutdown triggered by:
- Ethics policy violation detected
- Safety threshold breached
- Unauthorized modification detected
- Regulatory order received

### 6.3 Recovery Process
1. System halted and isolated
2. Incident investigation
3. Root cause analysis
4. Remediation plan
5. External review (if required)
6. Phased restart with monitoring

## 7. Human Oversight

### 7.1 Human-in-the-Loop (HITL)
Required for:
- Critical safety decisions
- Irreversible actions
- High-consequence operations
- Ethical edge cases

### 7.2 Human-on-the-Loop (HOTL)
Required for:
- Routine operations with monitoring
- Automated decision review
- Pattern analysis and intervention

### 7.3 Oversight Structure
- Technical operators (day-to-day)
- Ethics review board (quarterly)
- External oversight panel (annual)
- Public accountability (annual report)

## 8. Compliance & Enforcement

### 8.1 Internal Enforcement
- Automated policy checking
- Pre-deployment review
- Continuous monitoring
- Incident response procedures

### 8.2 External Compliance
- **EU 2021/821**: Dual-use export control
- **ITAR/EAR**: US export regulations (if applicable)
- **GDPR**: Privacy and data protection
- **National Laws**: Member state regulations

### 8.3 Violations
- **Minor**: Warning and remediation plan
- **Moderate**: Temporary suspension
- **Severe**: Permanent ban and legal action
- **Criminal**: Report to authorities

## 9. Ethics Review Process

### 9.1 Pre-Development Review

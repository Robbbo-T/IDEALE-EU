# AMPEL360 AIR TRANSPORT

**Air Transport Integration for AMPEL360 Platform**

## Overview

AMPEL360 AIR TRANSPORT focuses on the operational integration of the AMPEL360 BWB platform into civil air transport networks, including airport operations, air traffic management, and regulatory certification pathways.

## Purpose

- Integration with existing air transport infrastructure
- Certification and airworthiness compliance
- Operational procedures and training
- Airport compatibility and ground operations

## Scope

### Air Traffic Management
- Integration with ICAO/EASA flight management systems
- Communication, Navigation, and Surveillance (CNS) requirements
- Flight planning and route optimization

### Airport Operations
- Gate compatibility and turnaround procedures
- Ground support equipment requirements
- Passenger boarding and cargo handling
- Integration with H$_2$/LH$_2$ refueling infrastructure

### Regulatory Compliance
- EASA CS-25 (Large Aeroplanes) certification pathway
- FAA FAR Part 25 harmonization (if applicable)
- Environmental certification (noise, emissions)
- Export certificates and international operations

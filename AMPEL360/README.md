# AMPEL360

**Advanced Multi-Platform Efficient Logistics 360**

## Overview

AMPEL360 is the flagship blended-wing-body (BWB) aircraft platform within the ASI-T2 ecosystem, designed for maximum aerodynamic efficiency, control stability, and sustainable operations.

## Purpose

- **Aerodynamic Efficiency**: BWB configuration reduces drag and improves lift-to-drag ratio
- **Energy Optimization**: Reduced fuel consumption and emissions
- **Control Stability**: Enhanced flight characteristics through integrated design
- **Platform Integration**: Base for AMPEL 360PLUS space tourism demonstrators

## State (H0)

- **Maturity**: SIL (Software-in-the-Loop)
- **Current Deliverables**:
  - Basic flight envelope simulation
  - Digital twin (SIL)
  - Safety-lite case documentation

## Interfaces

- `MAL.v1.control` - Deterministic command interface
- `MAL.v1.telemetry` - Telemetry and monitoring interface
- `schemas/v1/ampel360.json` - Data schema

## Evidence

Per **Section 5** of the Master Whitepaper, all releases include:
- Signed videos/logs
- SBOM (Software Bill of Materials)
- DOI (Digital Object Identifier)
- Signed git tag
- UTCS (UiX Threading Context/Content/Cache & Structure/Style/Sheet) bundle

## MVP KPIs

- **Tracking Error**: Flight path deviation metrics
- **Simulated Energy**: Energy consumption per mission profile
- **Stability Margins**: Control authority and response
- **Simulated MTBF**: Mean Time Between Failures in simulation

## Standards (Lite)

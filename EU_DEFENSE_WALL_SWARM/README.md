# EU Defense Wall Swarm

**European Union Defense Wall - Ground-Based Swarm System**

## Overview

EU Defense Wall Swarm is a ground-based multi-agent system designed for perimeter defense, infrastructure protection, and security monitoring with strict ethical constraints.

## Purpose

- **Perimeter Defense**: Protective barrier systems
- **Infrastructure Protection**: Critical facility security
- **Security Monitoring**: Surveillance and threat detection
- **Non-Offensive Operations**: Defensive capabilities only

## State (H0)

- **Maturity**: Conceptual design
- **Current Deliverables**:
  - Threat assessment framework
  - Defensive posture algorithms
  - Non-lethal response protocols

## Roadmap

### H0 (0-90 days)
- [ ] Defensive strategy design
- [ ] Simulation framework
- [ ] MAL-EEM policy development

### H1 (3-9 months)
- [ ] 10-20 agent simulation
- [ ] Threat detection algorithms
- [ ] Non-lethal countermeasures

### H2 (9-24 months)
- [ ] Controlled testing
- [ ] External ethics review
- [ ] Limited deployment scenarios

## Architecture

### Domains
- **IIS** - Information & Intelligence Systems (defense)
- **LCC** - Linkages, Control & Communications
- **MEC** - Mechanical Systems Modules

### TFA Layers
- **QS**: Defensive state reference
- **FWD**: Threat prediction and assessment
- **UE**: Individual agent responses
- **FE**: Coordinated defense
- **CB**: Command and telemetry
- **QB**: Swarm state representation

## Ethics & Compliance - CRITICAL

**MAL-EEM** provides the strictest ethical governance:

### Allowed Uses (RESTRICTIVE)
- **Perimeter defense**: Passive barrier, no offensive projection
- **Infrastructure protection**: Critical civilian facilities only
- **Early warning**: Detection and alert systems
- **Non-lethal response**: Warning, deterrence only

### Prohibited Uses (ABSOLUTE)
- ❌ **No weaponisation**: Explicitly prohibited
- ❌ **No offensive operations**: Defensive posture only
- ❌ **No autonomous lethal decisions**: Human-in-the-loop mandatory
- ❌ **No indiscriminate systems**: Target discrimination required

### Export Control
- **EU 2021/821**: Dual-use export regulation compliance
- **ITAR/EAR**: As applicable for any US-origin components
- **National Regulations**: Member state laws supersede

### Decision Logging
- **Full audit trail**: All autonomous decisions logged
- **Human oversight**: Regular review of decision patterns
- **Kill-switches**: Multiple independent shutdown mechanisms

### Transparency
- **Open design**: Architecture publicly documented
- **Ethics review**: External independent review required
- **Public accountability**: Annual ethics impact reports

## Interfaces

- `MAL.v1.control` - Defensive command interface (human-in-loop)
- `MAL.v1.telemetry` - Agent telemetry
- Threat assessment data feeds

## Standards

- **EU 2021/821**: Dual-use export control
- **International Humanitarian Law**: Compliance in design
- **ARP4754A**: Systems development

## KPIs

- **False Positive Rate**: <5%
- **Response Time**: <2 seconds for threat detection
- **Coverage**: >95% of protected perimeter
- **Human-in-Loop Latency**: <10 seconds for critical decisions

## IDEALE-EU Alignment

- **Defense**: Protective, non-offensive capabilities
- **Intelligence**: Threat detection and assessment
- **ESG**: Ethical AI, responsible defense technology

## Governance

This system requires:
- Continuous external ethics oversight
- Annual independent audit
- Public transparency reports
- Stakeholder consultation

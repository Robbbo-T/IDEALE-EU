- Cryogenic exposure
- Fire and explosion risk
- Pressure system failures

### Risk Mitigation
- **Engineering Controls**: Intrinsically safe design
- **Administrative Controls**: Procedures and training
- **PPE**: Personal protective equipment
- **Monitoring**: Continuous hazard detection

### Safety Zones
- **Exclusion Zone**: No ignition sources, limited access
- **Controlled Zone**: Restricted access, monitoring
- **Buffer Zone**: Public protection distance

## Operations

### Refueling Procedures
1. Aircraft positioning and grounding
2. Pre-refueling checks
3. Connection and flow control
4. Post-refueling verification
5. Disconnection and departure clearance

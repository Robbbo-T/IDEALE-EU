# Sustainable Finance

**Anti-Speculative, Service-Aligned Financial System**

## Overview

Sustainable Finance provides the financial infrastructure for the ASI-T2 ecosystem with built-in mechanisms to prevent speculation, align incentives with service delivery, and ensure long-term sustainability.

## Purpose

- **Service Alignment**: Finance tied to SLOs and deliverables
- **Anti-Speculation**: Demurrage, lock-ups, and holding costs
- **Sustainable Funding**: Reserves and quadratic funding
- **Operational Credits**: Non-transferable service credits
- **Impact Verification**: Verifiable rewards for impact delivery

## State (H0)

- **Maturity**: Whitepaper and design phase
- **Current Deliverables**:
  - Financial model design
  - Tokenomics specification
  - Governance framework

## Roadmap

### H0 (0-90 days)
- [x] Finance whitepaper
- [ ] Tokenomics design
- [ ] Governance model

### H1 (3-9 months)
- [ ] Testnet deployment
- [ ] Smart contract audits
- [ ] Community testing

### H2 (9-24 months)
- [ ] Mainnet launch
- [ ] Treasury operations
- [ ] External audits

## Architecture

### Core Mechanisms

#### 1. Demurrage
Holding costs that discourage speculation:
- Gradual depreciation of speculative holdings
- Incentivizes productive use over hoarding
- Configurable rates based on holding period

#### 2. Lock-ups
Time-based restrictions:
- Vesting schedules for team/contributors
- Cliff periods for early participants
- Gradual unlock aligned with milestones

#### 3. Reserves
Stability mechanisms:
- Treasury reserves for operational continuity
- Buffer against volatility
- Emergency fund for critical operations

#### 4. Non-Transferable Operational Credits
Service-bound tokens:
- Earned through service delivery
- Redeemable for platform services
- Cannot be sold or speculated upon
- Expire if unused (use-it-or-lose-it)

#### 5. Quadratic Funding
Democratic resource allocation:
- Community-driven funding decisions
- Small donors have amplified impact
- Reduces plutocratic control
- Aligned with public good

#### 6. Verifiable-Impact Rewards
Merit-based incentives:
- Rewards for measurable outcomes
- Climate/energy metrics
- Safety improvements
- Socio-economic value

#### 7. SLO-Based Slashing
Penalty for non-performance:
- Service Level Objective breaches trigger penalties
- Stake at risk for providers
- Automated enforcement
- Appeal process for disputes

## Governance

### Multisig Treasury
- Multiple signers required for large operations
- Transparent transaction history
- Time-locked critical operations

### MAL-EEM Policies
Ethics-aligned financial decisions:
- Prohibited funding uses
- Dual-use review
- ESG compliance
- Public accountability

### Community Participation
- Proposal submission
- Voting mechanisms (quadratic)
- Transparent deliberation
- Regular reporting

## Domains

- **LIB** - Logistics, Inventory & Blockchain
- **OOO** - OS, Ontologies & Office Interfaces

## Tokenomics (Draft)

### Token Utility
- **Governance**: Voting on proposals
- **Staking**: Service provider stakes
- **Rewards**: Impact-based rewards
- **Operations**: Operational credits

### Supply Management
- Capped total supply (or controlled inflation)
- Burn mechanisms (from slashing)
- Predictable issuance schedule
- Transparent allocation

### Distribution
- Team/Contributors: X% (locked)
- Public Goods: X% (quadratic funding)
- Treasury: X% (reserves)
- Community: X% (rewards)

## Anti-Speculation Measures

### 1. Transaction Friction
- Small fees on transfers
- Increased fees for rapid trading
- Free for operational use

### 2. Holding Costs
- Demurrage on idle holdings
- Encourages circulation
- Discourages accumulation

### 3. Transferability Limits
- Operational credits non-transferable
- Governance tokens have cooldown periods
- Stake requires lock-up period

## Risk Management

### Volatility Control
- Reserves buffer against market swings
- Gradual unlock schedules
- Circuit breakers for extreme events

### Governance Attacks
- Quadratic voting reduces plutocracy
- Time-locked critical decisions
- Emergency multisig override

### Smart Contract Risk
- Multiple independent audits
- Bug bounty programs
- Gradual rollout with testnet
- Emergency pause capability

## KPIs

- **% Funds to Service/R&D**: >70% target
- **Volatility**: <20% monthly
- **SLO Compliance**: >95%
- **Community Participation**: >30% voter turnout

## Standards

- **ERC-20/ERC-721**: Token standards (if applicable)
- **Multi-sig**: Gnosis Safe or similar
- **Transparency**: On-chain governance
- **Audits**: Trail of Bits, OpenZeppelin, etc.

## IDEALE-EU Alignment

- **ESG**: Sustainable, responsible finance
- **Energy**: Funding for green innovation
- **Socio-Economic**: Accessibility and public good
- **Governance**: Democratic decision-making

## Security

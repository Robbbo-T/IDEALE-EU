## Title
Agency :: /the_garden (curated) + PRINT :: carpet trees (UTCS integrated)

## Summary
- Add curated Agency `/the_garden` (policy + catalog + schema + UTCS manifest)
- Add PRINT pipeline to generate poster-sized **carpet trees** (Graphviz)
- Wire artifacts into root UTCS (cache, structure, sheet)
- Keep canon: QS→FWD→UE→FE→CB→QB · UTCS · QOx · PAx OB/OFF, AMPEL360 commons only

## Evidence
- [ ] `cache/carpet_trees.pdf` generated (artifact attached)
- [ ] Catalog validates against schema
- [ ] UTCS manifest includes Agency + PRINT

## Canon checks
- [x] No "ONB/OUT"; only **OB/OFF**
- [x] QOx == **Quantum Optimizations**
- [x] AMPEL360 contains **no app code** (commons semantics)

## Key Components

### Primary Structure Elements
- Wing box (center section)
- Front spar
- Rear spar
- Ribs (distributed across span)
- Upper and lower skin panels
- Stringers and stiffeners

### Load Paths
- Aerodynamic loads distribution
- Inertia relief
- Landing gear attachment points
- Engine/propulsion mounting (if applicable)

## Analysis Domains

### Static Analysis
- Limit load cases (1.0g to 2.5g)
- Ultimate load cases (1.5x limit)
- Ground load cases

### Dynamic Analysis
- Flutter analysis
- Gust response
- Landing impact

### Optimization
- Weight minimization
- Stiffness requirements
- Manufacturing constraints

## Standards

- CS-25 / FAR Part 25 (Structural requirements)
- ARP4754A (Systems development)
- S1000D (Technical documentation)

## TFA V2 Compliance

All paths follow the canonical grammar:
```
domains/AAA/ATA-57/57-10_Wing_Primary_Structure/S1000D/<LAYER>/<PACK>/<SUBPACK>
```

Layers: QS, FWD, UE, FE, CB, QB (as required by analysis type)

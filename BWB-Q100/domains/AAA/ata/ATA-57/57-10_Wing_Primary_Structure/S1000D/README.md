## TFA V2 Layers

Content may be organized by TFA layers when required:
- **QS** (Primordial): Reference state and baseline data
- **FWD** (Prediction/Probability): Predictive models and probability distributions
- **UE** (Unit Element/Collapse): Discrete execution units and decisions
- **FE** (Federation Entanglement/Contracting): Cross-system contracts and SLOs
- **CB** (Classical Bit/Companion Binary): Deterministic binaries and artifacts
- **QB** (Bit Cubic): Non-quantum discrete 3D state representations

## Pack Descriptions

### CAx (Computer-Aided X)
Tools and data for computer-aided design and engineering:
- **CAD**: 3D models, drawings, geometry
- **CAE**: Finite element analysis, stress analysis
- **CFD**: Computational fluid dynamics (if applicable)
- **optimization/milp**: Structural optimization using MILP

### QOx (Quantum Optimizations)
Quantum-inspired optimization approaches:

# ATA-57-50: Systems Provisions and Interfaces

## Overview

Integration of various aircraft systems within the wing structure, including provisions, routing, and interfaces.

## Contents

### System Provisions
- Fuel system provisions and tankage
- Hydraulic system routing
- Electrical system distribution
- Pneumatic system integration
- Environmental control provisions

### Interfaces
- System mounting points
- Penetrations and pass-throughs
- Load transfer interfaces
- Serviceability provisions

### BWB-Specific Considerations

The blended-wing-body configuration places many systems within the wing body, requiring careful integration:
- Passenger cabin integration
- Cargo hold provisions
- System redundancy and separation
- Emergency egress

## Design Requirements

- Load path integrity
- Vibration isolation
- Thermal management
- Lightning protection
- EMI/EMC compliance

## Standards

- CS-25 / FAR Part 25
- ARP4754A (Systems integration)
- S1000D (Documentation)

# ATA-57-20: Control Surfaces

## Overview

Control surfaces for the BWB-Q100 platform, including ailerons, elevons, flaps, spoilers, and other flight control devices.

## BWB-Specific Design

The blended-wing-body configuration uses elevons (combined elevator and aileron) along the trailing edge to provide both pitch and roll control. This integrated approach requires careful coordination and control law design.

## Contents

### Control Surface Types
- **Elevons**: Combined pitch and roll control (primary)
- **Flaps**: High-lift devices for takeoff and landing
- **Spoilers/Airbrakes**: Drag devices and lift dumpers
- **Trim tabs**: Fine control authority adjustment

### Systems
- Actuation systems (hydraulic/electric)
- Control linkages and mechanisms
- Position sensors and feedback
- Redundancy and fail-safe design

## Standards

- CS-25 / FAR Part 25 (Flight controls)
- ARP4754A (Systems development)
- DO-178C (Software for control laws)
- S1000D (Documentation)

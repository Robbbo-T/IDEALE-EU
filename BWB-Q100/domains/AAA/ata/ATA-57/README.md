# ATA-57: Wings

## Overview

ATA Chapter 57 covers the wing structure and systems for the BWB-Q100 platform. This includes primary structure, control surfaces, joints, access panels, system provisions, and repair procedures.

## Scope

The blended-wing-body configuration integrates the wing structure with the fuselage, requiring specialized analysis and design approaches covered in this chapter.

## Subchapters

- **57-00**: General - Wing system overview and general information
- **57-10**: Wing Primary Structure - Main structural elements, spars, ribs, skin
- **57-20**: Control Surfaces - Ailerons, flaps, spoilers
- **57-30**: Joints, Fasteners, Bonding - Structural connections
- **57-40**: Access Panels and Fairings - Maintenance access and aerodynamic fairings
- **57-50**: Systems Provisions and Interfaces - Integration with other systems
- **57-90**: Repairs and Alterations - Maintenance and modification procedures

## TFA V2 Architecture

Each subchapter follows the TFA bridge grammar:
```
domains/AAA/ata/ATA-57/<XX-XX>_<DESCRIPTION>/S1000D/<LAYER>/<PACK>/<SUBPACK>
```

### Layers
- **QS**: Primordial reference state
- **FWD**: Predictive/probabilistic dynamics
- **UE**: Unit element execution
- **FE**: Federation entanglement/contracting
- **CB**: Classical bits/binaries
- **QB**: Bit cubic (non-quantum)

### Packs
- **CAx**: Computer-Aided X (CAD, CAE, CFD)
- **QOx**: Quantum optimizations
- **PAx**: Packaging & assemblies (ONB/OUT)

## Standards

- ATA iSpec 2200 (Technical publications)
- S1000D (Structured technical documentation)
- ARP4754A (Systems development)
- ARP4761 (Safety assessment)

## BWB-Specific Considerations

The blended-wing-body configuration presents unique challenges:
- Distributed lift across the entire planform
- Integrated control surface design
- Load distribution and structural optimization
- Aerodynamic/structural coupling

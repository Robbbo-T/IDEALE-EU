# Hall of Records

## Overview

The Hall of Records is a comprehensive index of all ASI-T2 releases, providing transparency, traceability, and reproducibility for the entire ecosystem.

## Purpose

- **Transparency**: Public record of all releases
- **Traceability**: Complete evidence chain from concept to deployment
- **Reproducibility**: Instructions and artifacts to reproduce any release
- **Auditability**: Independent verification of claims and compliance

## Index Format

Each release is recorded with the following information:

```yaml
release:
  version: vX.Y.Z
  date: YYYY-MM-DD
  horizon: H0 / H1 / H2
  classification: PUBLIC-DRAFT / PUBLIC / CONTROLLED
  
  evidence:
    git_tag: vX.Y.Z
    git_hash: <sha256>
    sbom: evidence/sboms/sbom-vX.Y.Z.spdx.json
    sbom_hash: <sha256>
    utcs_bundle: evidence/utcs_bundles/utcs-vX.Y.Z.yaml
    utcs_hash: <sha256>
    doi: 10.XXXXX/XXXXXX

## Verification Guide

### For Releases

To verify a release:

1. **Clone Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Robbbo-T/IDEALE-EU.git
   cd IDEALE-EU
   ```

2. **Checkout Release**
   ```bash
   git checkout vX.Y.Z
   ```

3. **Verify Signature**
   ```bash
   git tag -v vX.Y.Z
   ```

4. **Verify SBOM**
   ```bash
   sha256sum -c evidence/hashes/sbom-vX.Y.Z.spdx.json.sha256
   ```

5. **Verify UTCS Bundle**
   ```bash
   sha256sum -c evidence/hashes/utcs-vX.Y.Z.yaml.sha256
   ```

6. **Verify Demos**
   ```bash
   sha256sum -c evidence/hashes/demos-vX.Y.Z.sha256

7. **Reproduce Results**
   ```bash
   ./scripts/reproduce-vX.Y.Z.sh
   ```

### For DOIs

Each release has a DOI (Digital Object Identifier) registered with Zenodo or similar repository:
